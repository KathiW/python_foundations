# Lab: Fizz Buzz - Blinky Edition

## Summary: 

Surprisingly, lots of professional programmers can't really 
code[1]. FizzBuzz is a classic interview question for sussing-out 
the non-skilled. 
                  
Here it is:
    Write a program that sequentially lights up an LED in a square grid.
    But--
      * For multiples of 3 color the LED red 
      * For the multiples of 5 color the LED green
      * For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5 color the LED blue

## Requirements
* Pause for .2 seconds before moving on to the next item
* Start over again at the beginning
